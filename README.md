### Something about alise.konivcenko
Hi all, my name is **Alice**. I have been working for more than 6 years in a FinTech company, as an *accountant*. I have completed a bachelor's degree in finance and am currently in the process of getting a master's degree. I'm at the finish line and it remains to write a master's thesis.
Unfortunately, after working for 6 years in position of accountant, I realized that my interests have changed a little since my student years. I want to try something new. My choice fell on IT as I believe that this is **the industry of the _future_** and even an accountant in the future is 50% or even more-an IT specialist.
My hobbies are motorcycle :motorcycle: riding. I passed the motorcycle license 3 years ago and bought a motorcycle straight afterwards. Riding a motorcycle helps ~~to forget about all the problems~~ and lifts the mood. Check out this photo with my moto.

Also I love hiking with my friend – in the summer we can walk more than 20 kilometers in one evening.
As I decided to try to study something from IT –I have finished the QA manual testing courses in cool place called “Acodemy” – check out [their website](https://acodemy.lv/lv).
And as I want to continue develop my skills, learn and in the future change my profession - now I am here – learning automated testing.
Wish you all good luck and thank you Nikita :trollface: for such nice and funny examples for complicated things. It is much easier to understand :brain:
